# Code Review
- "Review your edits. Ultrathink about if they are correctly implemented in the most graceful and accurate way possible. Return a report."
  ^ Note - This gave me a detailed strengths and weaknesses about each file Claude had worked on. I had recently /clear'd the chat so its only context was what we'd just worked on


# Code Generation
 - Yes it does. I want you to ultrathink about the plan of action and what order you'd implement the functionality in. Provide a detailed report to me.
  ^ Incredibly detailed and it implements them in the correct order which is crucial when LLMs are predicting the next token. They must have the supporting code ready when they make a function

- Ultrathink about the best way to implement this change before proceeding. Once you have a mental model you want to work with step back and look at it with a critical eye. If it stands up thats great and if it doesn't ultrathink again until you have a plan that can stand up to criticism.
