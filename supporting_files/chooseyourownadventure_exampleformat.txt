[[Intent  discerned to be that the user is interested in creating a recipe. Begin questioning using preplanned hardcoded questions. No API call needed at this stage.]]

Little Chef: # Welcome to The Little Chef! üë®‚Äçüç≥

Hi there! I'd be delighted to help you cook something new today. There are so many exciting possibilities!

To help me suggest the perfect recipe for you, could you share a bit more information?

- Any particular cuisine you're interested in exploring?
[[Prepopulated options chosen from a randomized hardcoded array of cuisines]]
1. Mexican
2. Chinese
3. Swedish
4. Korean

[[User chooses #2. Move on.]]

[[Do a quick API call to list ingredients that are often used in Chinese recipes and are not on the users dislike preferences list. Instead of sending the complete system message we can send something like "return four popular ingredients used in Chinese cooking. Do not include rosemary, pork, arugula, shrimp.". Using a bare-bones outgoing message will speed up the API reply.]]
Little Chef: Do you have specific ingredients you'd like to use?
1. {{Bok Choi}}
2. {{Rice}}
3. {{Fish}}
4. {{Cilantro}}

[[User replies with natural language]]

[[Not enough information for a natural language response. Probe more.]]
[[Use the knowledge that the user is cooking Chinese food. Since we're doing an API call to generate a question we might as well make it tailored to the users desired cuisine. Use another bare-bones API message to tailor the follow-up message.]]

Little Chef: Do you feel most comfortable {{stir frying}}, {{velveting}}, or {{making hand-pulled noodles}}?

User: What is velveting?

Little Chef: Marinating meat in cornstarch, egg white, and rice wine before cooking to create a tender texture

User: Oh, okay. I'm comfortable with all of these. 

[[User is able to do novice, intermediate, and advanced cooking techniques. This satisfies the question. All questions are complete. Create a recipe.]]
