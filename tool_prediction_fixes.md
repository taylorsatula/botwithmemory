Fixes implemented:
1. Fixed metrics persistence - added detailed debugging and auto-creation of metrics file
2. Enhanced sequence prediction - improved get_likely_next_tools() to prioritize significant patterns
3. Fixed conversation tool selection - better integration of sequence predictions
4. Enhanced keyword scoring - added position and specificity weighting
5. Improved learning from missed tools - analyze user message to extract keywords
6. Context-aware tool usage recording - added message passing between components
7. Reset data for clean start - created fresh selector data file

Future TF-IDF Implementation Notes:
These fixes provide a foundation for the TF-IDF implementation by:
1. Ensuring user messages are captured and associated with tool usage
2. Setting up scoring mechanisms that can be extended with TF-IDF weights
3. Establishing proper data persistence to build the corpus needed for TF-IDF
4. Creating modular scoring approach that can incorporate new methods
